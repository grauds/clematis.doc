# Update Spring Boot 2 Backend

After a new instance of Keycloak is up and running, 
Spring Boot 2 backend can work with the HTTPS version of the new instance after
the Keycloak URL and the application shared secret are updated. There is only one condition to meet:
the Keycloak certificate has to be imported into the Docker container of Spring Boot backend.

## Updating Keycloak Endpoint

As a reminder, the following dependency is being used:

````groovy title="build.gradle"
dependencies {
//...
    implementation 'org.keycloak:keycloak-spring-boot-starter:25.0.3'
//...    
}
````

Checking the application configuration:

````yaml title="src/main/resources/application.yml"
spring:
  auth:
    authServer: "${KEYCLOAK_URL}:${KEYCLOAK_PORT}/realms/${keycloak.realm}/protocol/openid-connect"
    clientSecret: ${KEYCLOAK_SECRET}
````
The placeholders are properties taken from the environment variables for the Docker container, 
for example:
````
KEYCLOAK_URL=http://192.168.1.157
KEYCLOAK_PORT=443
KEYCLOAK_SECRET=${KEYCLOAK_SECRET}
KEYCLOAK_CLIENT=clematis-money-tracker-api
````

And I also had to update Jenkins secret named ```MT_API_KEYCLOAK_SECRET``` which is being copied 
into the ```KEYCLOAK_SECRET``` during the build.

:::tip[Can Be Done Better]
Keycloak adapter won't support Spring Boot 3, so migration off this dependency is planned, also improving
maintainability of the security layer.

## Importing Keycloak Certificate

The same certificate which I [downloaded earlier](keycloak-https.md#how-to-trust-a-certificate) to install on my MacBook, I will
use to make the next step:

<img src={require('@site/static/img/valid_keycloak_certificate.png').default} width="730px"></img>

I have to add it to the Java trusted certificate store in the Docker container 
of the Money Tracker API application for
the application to trust the certificate and establish an HTTPS connection to Keycloak.

:::info
Java ```cacerts``` file as a trusted certificate store, typically located in the jre/lib/security directory.
This file holds certificates from [Certificate Authorities (CAs)](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19860-01/html/E37451/gskee.html#scrolltoc)
that are trusted by the Java Runtime Environment. 
:::

### Jenkins Configuration

Since the builds and deploys are handled by Jenkins, the ultimate destination for Keycloak certificate is the
internal [Jenkins storage for secret files](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/using/using-credentials/).

The ID for the secret file in this example is ```keycloak_certificate```.

### Jenkins Pipeline Modification

Now then we have a secret file in Jenkins, we just need to copy it to the workspace filesystem
where the Docker build process can find it, for example:

````jenkins title="Jenkinsfile"
     stage('Build docker image') {
        steps {
            script {
               // Using secret file
               withCredentials([
                  file(credentialsId: 'keycloak_certificate', variable: 'SSL_CERT'),
               ]) {
                  sh """
                     cp "$SSL_CERT" "${WORKSPACE}/jenkins/keycloak.pem"
                     docker build -t clematis.mt.api .
                  """
               }
            }
        }
    }
    
    // clean up the pem file 
    post {
        always {
            sh '''
               rm -rf "${WORKSPACE}/jenkins/keycloak.pem"
            '''
        }
    }

````

The line ```cp "$SSL_CERT" "${WORKSPACE}/jenkins/keycloak.pem"``` will copy the file from 
the secret storage to the file system.

### Docker Container Build Modification

Docker will have to import the certificate with ```keytool```, so the original file gets
two more lines of code:

```dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
# Import Keycloak Cert to JRE cacerts
COPY jenkins/keycloak.pem /tmp/keycloak.pem
RUN keytool -importcert -file /tmp/keycloak.pem -alias keycloak -cacerts -storepass changeit -noprompt
```

After build and redeployment, the application is able to connect to Keycloak securely and validate
the tokens sent to its REST API.

Note that the REST API itself is still served over HTTP.

## Letting Spring Know It Is Behind A Proxy

The last but not the least is for Spring to be able to generate HATEOAS links with a correct address
and protocol. However, java backend doesn't know anything about the frontend load balancer or proxy. In 
our case we have an Openresty proxy working for Angular and serving content in HTTPS. Links generated 
for Spring HATEOAS will be the direct ones, like in the example below:

````json title="https://192.168.1.118:18443/api/commodities/5"
{
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "http://192.168.1.119:8080/api/commodities/52"
    },
    "commodity": {
      "href": "http://192.168.1.119:8080/api/commodities/52{?projection}",
      "templated": true
    }
  }
}
````

To fix this, one should add the following configuration to Spring Boot:

````yaml title="application.yml"
server:
  forward-headers-strategy: framework
````

and the following bean to the Spring Boot application:

````java 
@Bean
public ForwardedHeaderFilter forwardedHeaderFilter() {
   return new ForwardedHeaderFilter();
}
````

To check if the `X-forwarded-*` are actually being sent by Openresty:

````bash
sudo tcpdump -A -i any port 18085 | grep -i forwarded
````
