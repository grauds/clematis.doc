# Using VSCode Test Explorer For TDD

A useful tip on how to lay out your workspace in 
Microsoft Visual Code during the phase of development
where extensive testing is required, for instance, 
while fixing bugs or making more tests:

<img src={require('@site/static/img/test-explorer.png').default} style={{width: '1200px'}} alt={''}/>

[Test Explorer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/test/run-unit-tests-with-test-explorer?view=vs-2022)
may come in handy showing the test
tree on the left with the recent statuses. 
The sources and the test sources are in the center 
to quickly go back and forth from the tests to 
the code and fix things.
