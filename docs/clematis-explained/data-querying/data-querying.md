# Data Querying

All projects use different technology for asynchronous data exchange with backends; 
however, under the hood, either
[XMLHttpRequests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest)
or [fetch API](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_api_fetch.asp) is used.

Also, worth noting, the data transfer objects in this section often repeat 
[the ones on the server-side](http://localhost:3000/grauds/docs/clematis-explained/serving-data/data-transfer-objects).
