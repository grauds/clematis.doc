# Overview

## What are these projects?

This is a collection of some home projects and prototypes, 
web applications mostly, in different life-cycle stages 
and with different degree of maturity. 
The purpose of this documentation is to give an overview 
of the tech stack used in a form of portfolio:

1. [Money Tracker](https://github.com/grauds/money.tracker.ui) - application for home budget reports.
2. [Pomodoro](https://github.com/grauds/clematis.poc.pomodoro) - implementation of Pomodoro technique for time management.
3. Cosmic - application for scientific calculation, not an open source project at the moment.


## Special thanks

This work would not be possible if not for a number of awesome open-source projects:

1. [NgxHateoasClient](https://github.com/lagoshny/ngx-hateoas-client) for Money Tracker
2. TBA
