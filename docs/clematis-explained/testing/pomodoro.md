# Pomodoro Testing

Pomodoro doesn't use [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/), since
Enzyme library is [discontinued](https://dev.to/wojtekmaj/enzyme-is-dead-now-what-ekl),
the official replacement for it is
[React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).
