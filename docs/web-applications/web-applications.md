# Web Applications

## What are these projects?

This is a collection of some home projects and prototypes, 
web applications mostly, in different life-cycle stages 
and with different degrees of maturity:

1. [Money Tracker](https://github.com/grauds/money.tracker.ui): application for home budget reports.
2. [Pomodoro](https://github.com/grauds/clematis.poc.pomodoro): implementation of Pomodoro technique for time management.
3. Cosmic: application for scientific calculation, not an open source project at the moment.
4. Clematis Storage: application to store files either in a database or in the file system.
5. Clematis Weather: application to store weather archive and to present a relevant picture for 
a day depending on the weather on that day.


## Special thanks

This work would not be possible if not for a number of awesome open-source projects:

1. [NgxHateoasClient](https://github.com/lagoshny/ngx-hateoas-client) for Money Tracker
2. TBA
