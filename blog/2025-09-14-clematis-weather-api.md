One of the [previously planned](./2025-03-20-new-ideas.md) features to add to the Clematis Weather API, it is now a new 
repository on GitHub: https://github.com/grauds/clematis.weather. This is a work in progress,
the results are yet to be improved, no releases yet, but the basic functionality is there. Used CLIP to match
a weather image to a weather description.
