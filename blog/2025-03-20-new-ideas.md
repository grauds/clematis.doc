Throwing in some stuff to experiment with in addition to the
existing pet projects:

1. Backends for Frontends (BFF): we need some aggregation to
build the next web application, Clematis Day. 
Will probably be using [https://bff-patterns.com](https://bff-patterns.com/).
2. Use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to build the next
web application.
3. Use [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/) in the next web application to 
get a feeling of how to be ready for any UIKit.
4. Deploy Clematis Auth API to Yandex Cloud.
5. Add ML to Clematis Weather API to select a weather picture.
